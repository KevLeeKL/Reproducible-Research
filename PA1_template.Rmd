## R Markdown
This is the course project 1 for Reproducible Research course week 2

```{r}
## load data and transform

data <- read.csv("activity.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",", na.strings = "NA")
data$date <- as.Date(data$date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
data$interval <- factor(data$interval)
```
## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
1.Calculate the total number of steps taken per day

```{r}
NA_index <- is.na(as.character(data$steps))
data_no_NA <- data[!NA_index,]
head(data_no_NA)
```
```{r}
#Creating a data frame with the steps taken for each day
steps_each_day <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = data_no_NA, sum)
#Adding column names to the created data frame
colnames(steps_each_day) <- c("date", "steps")
```

2.If you do not understand the difference between a histogram and a barplot, research the difference between them. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

```{r}
hist(as.numeric(steps_each_day$steps), breaks = 20, col = "red", xlab = "Number of Steps", main= "Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day")
```

3.Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day

```{r}
mean(steps_each_day$steps)
```
```{r}
median(steps_each_day$steps)
```
## What is the average daily activity pattern? 
1. Make a time series plot (i.e. \color{red}{\verb|type = "l"|}type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
```{r}
#Calculating the average
steps_per_interval <- aggregate(data_no_NA$steps, by=list(interval=data_no_NA$interval), FUN=mean)

#Adding columns names
colnames(steps_per_interval) <- c("interval", "average_steps")

#ploting the average daily activity pattern 
plot(as.integer(levels(steps_per_interval$interval)), steps_per_interval$average_steps, type="l",
     xlab = "Interval", ylab = "Average Number of Steps", main = "Average Daily Activity Pattern",  col ="blue")
```


2. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

```{r}
#The maximum number of average steps
max_steps <- max(steps_per_interval$average_steps)
max_steps
```
```{r}
#The 5-minute interval that contains the maximum number of steps
intervale_max_steps<-steps_per_interval[which.max(steps_per_interval$average_steps),]$interval
intervale_max_steps
```

##Imputing missing values
1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with 𝙽𝙰s)

```{r}
sum(is.na(as.character(data$steps)))
```
```{r}
sum(is.na(as.character(data$date)))
```
```{r}
sum(is.na(as.character(data$interval)))
```

2. Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.

```{r}
#finding the indices of missing values (NAs)
NA_index <- which(is.na(as.character(data$steps)))
complete_data <- data
#Imputing missing values using the mean for that 5-minute interval
complete_data[NA_index, ]$steps<-unlist(lapply(NA_index, FUN=function(NA_index){
                steps_per_interval[data[NA_index,]$interval==steps_per_interval$interval,]$average_steps
                }))
```

3. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

```{r}
summary(complete_data)
```
```{r}
str(complete_data)
```
4. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?

```{r}
#Creating a data frame with the steps taken for each day
steps_each_day_complete <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = complete_data, sum)
#Adding column names to the created data frame
colnames(steps_each_day_complete) <- c("date", "steps")

#Making the histogram
hist(as.numeric(steps_each_day_complete$steps), breaks = 20, col = "red", xlab = "Number of Steps", main= "Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day")
```
```{r}
mean(steps_each_day_complete$steps)
```
```{r}
median(steps_each_day_complete$steps)
```
## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

1. Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

```{r}
#Creating a factor variable "day "to store the day of the week
complete_data$day <- as.factor(weekdays(complete_data$date))

#Creating a logical variable "is_weekday" (weekday=TRUE, weekend = FALE) 
complete_data$is_weekday <- ifelse(!(complete_data$day %in% c("Saturday","Sunday")), TRUE, FALSE) 


#Calculating the average number of steps for weekdays
weekdays_data <- complete_data[complete_data$is_weekday,]
steps_per_interval_weekdays <- aggregate(weekdays_data$steps, by=list(interval=weekdays_data$interval), FUN=mean)


#Calculating the average number of steps for weekends
weekends_data <- complete_data[!complete_data$is_weekday,]
steps_per_interval_weekends <- aggregate(weekends_data$steps, by=list(interval=weekends_data$interval), FUN=mean)

#Adding columns names
colnames(steps_per_interval_weekdays) <- c("interval", "average_steps")
colnames(steps_per_interval_weekends) <- c("interval", "average_steps")
#Adding a column to indecate the day
steps_per_interval_weekdays$day <- "Weekday"
steps_per_interval_weekends$day <- "Weekend"

#Merging the two togather
week_data <- rbind(steps_per_interval_weekends, steps_per_interval_weekdays)
#Converting the day variabke to a factor
week_data$day <- as.factor(week_data$day)
```
2. Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). See the README file in the GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot should look like using simulated data.

```{r}
#Making the plot
library(lattice)
xyplot(average_steps ~  interval | day, data = week_data, layout = c(1,2), type ="l", ylab="Number of Steps")
```
